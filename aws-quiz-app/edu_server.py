# --- The tutor can SEE the page's visuals (22-09-26) -------------------------
# Until today the tutor was blind to every figure and equation in the lesson it
# was tutoring. source_for_block() builds the lesson text from `content`, callout
# `items` and code `cells` ONLY, so a `figure` or `equation` block was dropped
# whole -- the model never even saw the caption. Asked "what does Figure 2-9
# show?" it had nothing at all and answered from general knowledge.
#
# Two layers, cheapest first:
#
# 1. ALWAYS -- put what the package already knows into the context: each visual's
#    title, caption, alt, `description` (written by the 22-09-26 backfill; still
#    absent from every figure on the box at the time of writing and handled as
#    absent), and for an equation its LaTeX. 88 of the 90 equations carry
#    `latex`, which the model reads natively, so MATH IS LARGELY SOLVED WITHOUT
#    VISION and costs a few hundred characters.
# 2. ONLY when the question is about a picture that LAYER 1 CANNOT ANSWER --
#    attach the actual PNG. See ask_wants_image() for the trigger and why it
#    cannot fire on an ordinary text question.
#
# A STORED DESCRIPTION BEATS A FRESH READING (user ruling, 22-09-26). A
# description is written once, checked, and identical on every ask; a vision
# reply is a reading, and two readings of one crop disagree -- measured on
# fig-2-10, where one run got the ordering exactly right and another called two
# bars "roughly symmetrical" when the ground truth is 6,570 against 3,620. So
# once a figure carries a usable description the picture is NOT sent, whatever
# the question. That branch shipped on 22-09-26 and could not fire until the
# backfill landed; see ask_wants_image() condition 3.
#
# Scope is the CURRENT BLOCK, never the chapter: this tutor's value is being
# cheap enough to use constantly, and a whole chapter's visual metadata on every
# ask would be several KB of prompt the reader did not ask for.

# the bucket lacks that much headroom the ask still answers, from text only:
# degrading the answer beats a 429 mid-lesson, and it can never drain the budget

#    determiner is required and it is what makes the trigger tight: "how do I
#    plot a histogram in pandas?" is a code question and does NOT match, while

# c) the "layer 1 cannot answer this" half is NO LONGER A VERB TEST. It used to
#    be a "show/see/read/where" regex, which meant a figure WITH a description
#    still escalated for "what does the y-axis read?". Retired 22-09-26 by user
#    ruling (above): the question no longer decides, the presence of a usable
#    stored description does. Conditions (a) and (b) are untouched.

         buys nothing. A lesson with no figure can never escalate, whatever is asked.

         or a DETERMINER plus a visual noun ("the chart", "this histogram"). The
         determiner is the tight part: "how do I plot a histogram in pandas?" has
         the noun but no determiner pointing at the page, so it does not match.
         A bare visual noun never fires.
      3. LAYER 1 CANNOT ANSWER IT -- the target figure has NO usable stored
         `description`. A figure that carries one is answered from that text and
         the picture is never sent, whatever the question is (user ruling,
         22-09-26: a written description is steady, a vision reading is not).
         Before the backfill every figure was description-less, so this condition
         was always true and every figure escalated; that is the behaviour this
         replaces, not a behaviour it breaks.
