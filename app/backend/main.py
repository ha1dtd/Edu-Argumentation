"""FastAPI application for the edu-study stack on :8792.

Phase 02 of the edu-replatform program: the new stack stood up EMPTY. One API route
(/api/health) plus the built SPA. None of the legacy app's 15 routes are ported yet —
that is Phases 3-4, and gates/gate-routes.mjs burns the list down.

⛔ SINGLE WORKER. THREE independent causes, all of which must be removed before a second
   worker is ever correct (decision D-C1). A reader who sees only cause (a) will "fix" it
   and then wonder why counts still diverge:
     (a) [legacy only] save_settings mutates os.environ live  edu_server.py:1153-1154 —
         :8792 reads provider.env per call instead (D-P4-2), so (a) is gone here
     (b) THREE in-process rate-limit deques keyed on client IP (RUN_HISTORY left with the
         runner, ruling R24): REQUEST_HISTORY 20/3600s · ASK_HISTORY 60/600s ·
         EXERCISE_HISTORY 30/600s
     (c) THREE in-process caches   _MODULE_CACHE L314 · _BOOK_CACHE L59
                                   · _BOOK_DF / _BOOK_CHAPTERS L60-61
   Moving settings out of the environment buys ZERO concurrency, because (b) and (c)
   survive it untouched.

⛔ AI/PROVIDER HANDLERS MUST BE PLAIN ``def``, NEVER ``async def`` (plan C3). They block on
   urlopen with a 120 s timeout. Under ``async def`` that blocks the whole event loop and
   the service stops answering everything, including health. Under plain ``def`` FastAPI
   runs them in a threadpool, which is the behaviour we want. Phase 2 has no such handler;
   the rule is recorded here before the first one is written.

⛔ /book/ AND /assets/<moduleId>/ ARE CUSTOM FileResponse ROUTES, NEVER StaticFiles
   (plan C4, landed in Phase 03 slice D). StaticFiles serves anything beneath its root,
   which would drop the ASSET_FILE allowlist — import-report.json (233 KB of import
   internals) sits beside module.json and must stay non-servable. FileResponse also streams
   instead of reading a 5.4 MB asset into RAM.
   ⚠ CORRECTED 21-09-26 (measured): import-report.json is NOT "in every library package".
   It exists under openintro-statistics-2019-1045f2f5 and is ABSENT under geron-homl3, so
   only the openintro module is a real gate for it.

⛔ PHASE 04 WRITES (23-09-26). SEVEN POST routes (ruling R24 removed the three /api/run*) of the frozen contract are ported in the
   legacy's ORDER OF CHECKS (edu_server.py:do_POST): route allowlist -> same-origin ->
   progress -> rename -> settings -> provider configured -> access token -> ask /
   grade / quiz buckets -> body. A different order changes which error a caller sees, and a
   409-vs-429 difference is a behaviour change, not a refactor.
   Progress and titles are written to the SAME files :8767 uses (store.py, decision D-P4-1),
   under a lock, in the legacy byte format.

#
# The SPA's hashed bundles are served from the prefix "/assets" — Vite's default, kept
# deliberately and NAMED here rather than left for Phase 3 to rediscover. That prefix is
# SHARED with the guarded per-module route Phase 3 adds at /assets/<moduleId>/<file>.
#
# They stay separate because Starlette matches in REGISTRATION ORDER: the API routes and
# (from Phase 3) the two guarded file routes are registered BEFORE this mount, so the
# 2-segment guarded route claims module assets, 1-segment build assets fall through to the
# mount, and a guarded 403 does NOT fall through to the mount. Registering the mount first
# would shadow every guarded route and silently remove the ASSET_FILE allowlist.
#
# ⛔ StaticFiles is mounted over /srv/foxai/edu-study/web/ ONLY — a directory that contains
# nothing but Vite build output. NEVER over the web root, NEVER over ~/foxai-data/, and
# NEVER over the book or asset stores, where import-report.json sits beside module.json.

# instead of a 404. The middleware has already demanded a session for it.
# ⛔ An unknown /api (or /book, /data) path is NOT a page: flat 404 JSON, never the SPA document,
