"""Live quiz rooms — HTTP + WebSocket (study-rooms-qna P3, 30-09-26).

  POST /api/rooms            {bookId, blocks[], qCount 5-30, secs 10|20|30} -> {code, qCount, requested}
                             409 {error, code} if the account already owns an open room; 429 at the room cap
  GET  /api/rooms/{code}     -> lobby snapshot | 404
  WS   /api/rooms/{code}/ws  client: join · start (owner) · answer{qIdx,choice} · next (owner) · pong
                             server: lobby · question (NO `correct`) · answered · reveal · final · ended · ping

⛔ `async def` (the plan's standing-rule carve-out, F14): the store is an asyncio.Lock-guarded
   in-memory structure on the event loop. Blocking work (module load, session lookup) goes through
   run_in_threadpool.
⛔ THE HTTP MIDDLEWARE NEVER RUNS FOR A WEBSOCKET (M7). The WS handler checks, in order and BEFORE
   accept(): same-origin (main.origin_ok — the rule _gate uses), the session (main.session_lookup —
   the lookup require_session uses), the room, the caps. Then accept(); a failed check closes at
   once with 4403 (origin/session), 4404 (unknown room), 4429 (cap) or 1011 (account store down),
   and NO data frame is ever sent first.
⛔ The player's identity and display name come from the session account, never from `join`.
⚠ `import main as core` and core.X at CALL time only (main is partially initialised when addons load).
⚠ Named residuals (P3 report): the threadpool (40) is shared by slow model calls and these handshake
   session lookups; the per-socket message RATE is not capped (64 KB frames bound each message).
