"""Live quiz rooms — the in-memory room store (study-rooms-qna P3, 30-09-26).

ONE asyncio.Lock guards every room. Everything here runs on the event loop: timers are asyncio
tasks, never threads (the unit has TasksMax=256).

⛔ SEND OUTSIDE THE LOCK (F18). Every broadcast snapshots (socket, payload) pairs under the lock,
   releases it, then sends each with a 5 s timeout. A client that times out or errors is dropped.
   One slow phone can never stall a room, and the lock is never held across a network write.
⛔ `correct` NEVER leaves the server before the reveal: question_frame() has no such key, and
   gates/gate-r-ws.py reads every captured question frame for it.
⚠ D2 (user decision 29-09-26): any signed-in reader can look the answer up in
   /book/<id>/module.json. The protocol still withholds `correct` until reveal, so the server
   never helps a cheater. Options keep the book's order (no per-room shuffle).
⚠ Nothing is persisted. A restart ends every room; a client then gets close 4404 -> "Room ended".
⚠ Caps are sized to the unit (M5): open-files soft limit 1024 -> <= 200 sockets; 20 rooms;
   30 players per room; 1 active owned room per account. The interval and cap constants below
   are MODULE constants: gates/gate-r-ws.py lowers them IN ITS OWN PROCESS. The live unit never
   sets them (no env override exists, F21).
