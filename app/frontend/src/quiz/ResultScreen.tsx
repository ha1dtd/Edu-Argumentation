// Seam 22 (quiz/ResultScreen) — THE SCORE, THE MESSAGE AND THE WAY BACK.
//
// Split out of showResults (93 lines — one of the six spanning functions). showResults
// was doing FOUR unrelated jobs; only the last two are this component:
//   1. SCREEN SWITCHING (hide landing/tutorial/settings/quiz, show result, close setup)
//      -> shell/AppShell. A screen does not hide its siblings.
//   2. THE TALLY (tallyScore/tallyTotal) -> state/quizReducer, as DERIVED SELECTORS.
//   3. THE MESSAGE + the two conditional notes -> here.
//   4. THE NAV (renderResultNav / returnToReader) -> here, as props.
//
// ⚑ 22-09-26 (EVL fix 004, D-10): jobs 3 and 4 ARRIVED. Until this slice the screen
//   switch did not exist at all, so this component's content rendered into a permanently
//   `display:none` section — the whole of D-10. The switch is now in AppShell (via
//   QuizScreen's finish effect); the two conditional notes and renderResultNav are below.
//
// ⛔ THE CARRIED TALLY, NOT THIS RUN'S RAW COUNT. A retry that fixes the last 3 of 20
//    must read 20/20, or the reader is told they failed an assessment they passed.
//
// ⚠ renderResultNav() is called BEFORE the 0% early return in the legacy code, and the
//   comment says why: "a zero score is exactly when the reader most needs a way back to
//   the block". In React the nav simply always renders — the hazard is only reintroduced
//   if someone early-returns a different tree at 0%.
//
// Contract DOM this seam owns: #restart-btn · #result-retry-wrong-btn
