// Seam 21 (quiz/OptionCard) — ⛔ **ONE** CARD, USED BY BOTH THE QUIZ AND THE EXERCISES.
//
// ⛔⛔ THE USER HAS OBJECTED TO BREAKING THIS **TWICE**. It is its own seam precisely so
//     it cannot drift into two look-alike components.
//     (user, 19-09-26: "import the animation and stuff from the actual quiz page so you
//      don't have to design new thing" … "when I select it would show the result with an
//      animation right away like the quiz page")
//
// In the legacy app this is the `tmpl-quiz-option` <template>, cloned by BOTH
// loadQuestion() and renderExercises(). Reusing it means the exercises inherit the quiz's
// hit area, hover, letter badge and the grid-template-rows explanation reveal — and there
// is ONE card design in this app instead of two that drift apart.
//
// Contract DOM this component owns:
//   .option-card · .option-letter · .option-text · .explanation-inner · .explanation-text
//   (and `#options-container .option-card …` for all four, when rendered by the quiz)
//
// ⛔⛔ D-11 — THE EXPLANATION IS NOT IN THE DOM UNTIL THE QUESTION IS ANSWERED.
//     FIXED 22-09-26 (EVL fix 005). This component used to render `{explanation}`
//     UNCONDITIONALLY. The closed card is 41px of padding with the content clipped, so the
//     FIRST LINE of every explanation showed through — and because the correct option's
//     explanation reads differently from the three distractors ("Mitchell's definition is…"
//     vs "Review the chapter explanation: …"), THE ANSWER WAS IDENTIFIABLE WITHOUT
//     ANSWERING. On a study app whose whole purpose is self-assessment that is an
//     assessment-integrity defect, not a cosmetic one.
//     ⛔ The fix is the LEGACY's: `tmpl-quiz-option` ships `.explanation-inner` **EMPTY**
//        (index.html:619) and handleAnswerSelect fills it (app.js:2942-2947). The element
//        still EXISTS closed — the frozen selector contract requires
//        `#options-container .option-card .explanation-inner` to resolve — it is just empty.
//     ⛔ DO NOT "fix" a leak of this shape by clipping, masking, colouring or shrinking.
//        Anything that leaves the text in the DOM leaves it readable by devtools, by text
//        selection, by a screen reader and by a screenshot. Absence is the only fix.
//     ⚠ It is invisible to R-B1, whose band (35 <= closed <= 45) is satisfied at 41px
//       whether the strip is empty or full — the padding is what measures, not the text.
//       Its gate is R-J5 (gate-r-journey.mjs), which reads the CLOSED card's text.
//
// ⛔⛔ D-12 — EVERY CARD RESOLVES ON ANSWER, NOT JUST THE ONES THE LEARNER TOUCHED.
//     FIXED 22-09-26 (EVL fix 005). The two call sites used to pass `reveal={null}` for the
//     unselected wrong options, so only 2 of 4 cards ever opened and NONE of them carried
//     the legacy's treatment. The legacy (app.js:2934-2983) loops ALL cards and gives each:
//       · `answered cursor-default`
//       · a title span — `Correct Answer` (text-emerald-400) or `Incorrect` (text-brand-400)
//       · the correct card: #10b981 border + rgba(16,185,129,.1) fill + an emerald badge
//       · the SELECTED wrong card: #ef4444 border + rgba(239,68,68,.1) fill + a red badge
//       · every OTHER card: `opacity-50`
//       · `expanded`, staggered `50ms * index`
//     ⚠ `reveal` is therefore 'correct' | 'incorrect' for EVERY card once answered, and null
//       ONLY while unanswered. `selected` is what separates the learner's wrong pick (red)
//       from the wrong options they did not choose (dimmed) — which is why both props exist.
//       Its gate is R-J6, and its expected card count is DERIVED from the question's own
//       options.length, never a literal `=== 4`.
//
// ⛔⛔ B1 — THE 0fr→1fr REVEAL. The CLOSED state of `.explanation-inner` is **41 px, NOT
//     0 px** (`px-6 pb-6 pt-4` = 16+24, plus a 1 px `border-t`). The gate is a BAND AND A
//     RATIO, never `=== 41`:
//         35 ≤ closed ≤ 45   AND   open > 100   AND   open > 2.5 × closed
//     ⛔ Do not "simplify" it to a literal: a legitimate padding change would turn a
//        correct build red — the same stale-literal class as F-1 and A-G17's `total===21`.
//     ⛔ The `≥ 35` FLOOR is not optional: `≤ 45` alone passes at 0 px, so dropping
//        .explanation-inner's padding entirely would read green.
//     ⚑ THE BAND SURVIVES D-11's FIX because the 41px is PADDING, not text: emptying the
//       inner removes content from a track that was already sized to 0fr.
//
// ⚠ B5b gates DOM IDENTITY, not class names: the quiz card and the exercise card must
//   emit the SAME CLASS SET and identical computed borderRadius, padding and
//   .option-letter geometry. Two components that merely LOOK alike pass a class-name
//   check and fail this one — which is the point. ⛔ Every change below is made in THIS ONE
//   component, so it lands on BOTH call sites by construction; that is the whole reason the
//   seam exists and the reason a "quick fix" must never be made at a call site instead.

 *
 * ⛔ `EXPLANATION_INNER`'s `px-6 pb-6 pt-4` IS THE 41px. 16 + 24 = 40px of vertical
