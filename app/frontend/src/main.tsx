// ⛔ THE TWO STYLESHEETS, AND THEIR ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. DO NOT SWAP THEM.
//    tailwind.css is the three @tailwind layers (item A, 22-09-26 — it replaced the runtime
//    Tailwind CDN <script> that used to sit in index.html). app.css is the hand-written
//    block ported rule-for-rule from the legacy app, whose body / scrollbar / print /
//    `#tutorial-content.prose` rules must WIN over Tailwind's utilities — exactly as the
//    legacy <style> block wins by sitting after the Tailwind block.
//    ⚠ Under the CDN that ordering was ACCIDENTAL: the CDN injected at runtime, so a static
//      sheet beat it whatever the import order. With a real build both are static CSS in one
//      emitted file and SOURCE ORDER DECIDES. Vite concatenates a single entry's CSS in
//      import order; measured in the built sheet, .px-6 @23860 < .hidden-view @34669 <
//      #tutorial-content.prose @35485 < @media print @36314.
//    ⛔ Slice A4/B added app.css; before that the React app shipped NO CSS at all, so
//      .hidden-view, the B1 reveal, the B2 KaTeX radical fix and the B3 reader-mode height
//      chain were all simply ABSENT while the tree typechecked cleanly.

// NO STATE LIBRARY (plan B2). Verified against the house reference: the CoreX console

// a decision, not a default.
