/**
 * gate-r-contract.mjs — ⚑ THE FLAGSHIP R- GATE: the frozen DOM contract resolves in the
 * MOUNTED REACT DOM.
 *
 * edu-replatform Phase 03, checklist E1c. Tier 1/2, browser-backed.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES
 *   Drives a STATE SWEEP — library -> narrow viewport -> book selected -> reader ->
 *   reader on an equation block -> reader on an exercise block (multiple-choice mode) ->
 *   quiz setup -> quiz -> settings -> ask — and asserts every contract entry resolves
 *   **>=1 time ACROSS the sweep**, never per page. `.option-card` only exists once an
 *   exercise is in choose-mode; `[data-block="*"]` only after a book is loaded. A per-page
 *   assertion would be red on a correct app.
 *
 * ⛔⛔ THE SWEEP ITERATES ALL **NINE** CATEGORIES ACTUALLY PRESENT IN THE FROZEN FILE:
 *       ids · classes.ours · classes.thirdParty · attributes · attributeExpressions ·
 *       tags · pseudo · hashRoutes · selectors
 *     ⛔ THE PLAN'S PROSE NAMES A CATEGORY THAT DOES NOT EXIST ON DISK — `katexClasses`.
 *        Measured 21/22-09-26: `classes` is NESTED `{ours, thirdParty}`, there is no
 *        `katexClasses` key, and `knownAbsent` is an ARRAY. A sweep written from the prose
 *        iterates a missing key, silently skips two real ones, and reads green.
 *     ⛔ `attributeExpressions` is ABSENT FROM THE CONTRACT'S OWN `counts` BLOCK. A sweep
 *        that enumerates `counts` skips the whole category — the one holding
 *        `[aria-current="true"]` and `[id$="-screen"]`. The category list below is derived
 *        from the FILE, and R-C5 asserts every top-level category was reached.
 *     ⛔ `attributes` holds BARE ATTRIBUTE NAMES (`aria-current`, `data-block`, …), not
 *        selectors. They are resolved as `[name]`. Passing them to querySelectorAll raw
 *        throws, and a try/catch around it would score them as "invalid" forever.
 *
 * ⛔ IT READS selector-contract.FROZEN.json, NEVER THE REGENERATED FILE.
 *    `gen-selector-contract.mjs` generates the contract FROM THE GATE SOURCES, so a React
 *    suite that queries fewer things regenerates a smaller contract and passes against it.
 *    That is A-G17's failure in a new costume. RS-FROZEN-SOURCE (gate-r-self.mjs) enforces it.
 *
 * ⛔ `?? []` ON knownAbsent IS BANNED. An empty list makes R-C3 ("each entry genuinely does
 *    not resolve") vacuously true. R-C2 asserts the list is non-empty AND exactly
 *    ['#home-screen'], so a second phantom cannot be added to dodge a red gate.
 *
 * ⛔ #home-screen IS A GENUINE PHANTOM, NOT A MISSING ELEMENT — in the contract's `ids`,
 *    queried by b15probe.mjs:12, and absent from the legacy index.html. DO NOT CREATE AN
 *    ELEMENT TO SATISFY A TYPO.
 *
 * ⛔⛔ R-C0 IS THE FLOOR THAT MAKES THE WHOLE FILE MEAN ANYTHING. The sweep runs against the
 *    LOCAL preview. That is only a claim about the deployed product if the local preview is
 *    serving the SAME BYTES. R-C0 compares the local index.html sha256 against :8792's.
 *    Without it this suite measures a build nobody is running.

 *    is a property of the CONTRACT (a phantom selector that was never real). This is a
 *    property of THIS PORT at THIS PHASE — work that is not done yet.
 *
 * ⛔ IT HAS TEETH IN BOTH DIRECTIONS (R-C6). A gap that starts resolving turns this gate
 *    RED until the entry is deleted from the list; an unlisted miss turns R-C1 RED. An
 *    allowance you can grow silently is not an allowance, it is a hole — which is exactly

   *   `run/reset`, so `#options-container` rendered zero option cards.
   *
   *   The fix (quiz/QuizSetupScreen.start, via the EXISTING `run/reset` + `scope/set` actions)
   *   made all four RESOLVE, so R-C6's reverse teeth fired exactly as designed and printed
   *       ⛔ NOW RESOLVING (delete it from PHASE_03_DECLARED_GAPS): ...
   *   Deleting them is what that message demands. ⛔ The effect is the OPPOSITE of an
   *   allowance: R-C1's allowed-misses drop 6 -> 2 and these four are now REQUIRED to resolve
   *   on every future run. Measured across the sweep: resolved 106/112 -> 110/112.
   *   ⛔ Never re-add an entry here to quiet a red. The list shrinks as work lands; it grows
   *      only for a gap that is declared, reasoned and out of scope — like the one above. */

// ⛔⛔ THE CARD CLICK IS A **TOGGLE**, NOT AN "OPEN" — REPAIRED 22-09-26 (EVL fix cycle 1).
//
//     ⚠ THIS IS A NAVIGATION-STEP REPAIR. ⛔ NO ASSERTION CHANGED, no expected count changed
//       (R-C0..R-C6, still 7 result lines). Recorded in full because editing a gate is exactly
//       the move this program forbids when it is done to make something pass — so here is the
//       measurement instead of an argument.
//
//     WHAT WAS WRONG: this step used to click UNCONDITIONALLY, assuming the click OPENS the
//     book. The legacy is a toggle — `openBook(file)` at aws-quiz-app/js/app.js:605-608 reads
//         if (file === activeBookFile) { closeBook(); return; }
//     The step only ever looked correct because the React port had a DEFECT (G-EVL-1): it never
//     auto-opened a book, so the first click always opened one. The sweep was therefore
//     CALIBRATED TO THE DEFECT, and fixing the product inverted it. Measured on the built
//     bundle, 22-09-26, `#setup-tree input[data-block]` / `#tutorial-main-title`:
//         after page load        boxes=310  title="What Machine Learning Actually Is"   OPEN
//         after 1 card click     boxes=0    title="Theory block 1"  (the placeholder)   CLOSED
//         after 2 card clicks    boxes=310  title="What Machine Learning Actually Is"   OPEN
//     Left as-is, the four states named 'book-selected', 'reader', 'reader-equation' and
//     'reader-exercise-choose' would all have been sampled against a CLOSED book — i.e. the
//     sweep would measure an empty reader while claiming to measure a loaded one. That is
//     strictly LESS assertion power, which is why leaving it was not the safe option.
//
//     WHAT IT IS NOW: idempotent, and the precondition is CHECKED rather than assumed. The
//     throw is deliberate in preference to a new PASS/FAIL line: a thrown gate exits non-zero,
//     which run-gates-react.sh reports as `EXIT <n> <-- FAIL`, so the suite still goes red —
//     without moving the frozen R- vector count by adding an eighth result line.
