/**
 * gate-r-self.mjs — THE R- SUITE'S OWN INVARIANT CHECK, and the home of the frozen
 * DOM-contract sha256 pin.
 *
 * edu-replatform Phase 03, checklist E0a / E0b. Runs LAST — it parses the transcripts the
 * R- suites above already produced (R5), so it launches no browser and re-runs nothing.
 *
 * ⛔⛔ WHY THE PIN BELOW IS THE MOST IMPORTANT LINE IN THE PHASE.
 *
 *   gates/selector-contract.json is GENERATED FROM THE GATE SOURCES by
 *   gen-selector-contract.mjs. A React suite that queries fewer things therefore regenerates
 *   a SMALLER contract and then passes against it — green, and meaningless. That is the
 *   A-G17 failure in a new costume (A-G17 passed 21/21 against an unfixed file).
 *
 *   So the React gates read selector-contract.FROZEN.json, never the regenerated file, and
 *   this pin is what stops the frozen copy being quietly re-frozen smaller. Regeneration is
 *   a Phase 04 decision, not a Phase 03 convenience.
 *
 * ⛔ THE PIN WAS TAKEN **AFTER** knownAbsent WAS ADDED, never before. knownAbsent does NOT
 *   exist in selector-contract.json; E1c assertions 2 and 3 read it, and freezing the file
 *   unchanged would leave them red forever — or, worse, "fixed" with `?? []`, which makes
 *   assertion 3 ("each entry genuinely does not resolve") VACUOUS ON AN EMPTY LIST.
 *   ⛔ `?? []` IS BANNED. RS-KNOWNABSENT asserts the list is non-empty and is EXACTLY
 *   ['#home-screen'], so a second phantom cannot be added to dodge a red gate.
 *
 * ⛔ #home-screen IS A GENUINE PHANTOM, NOT A MISSING ELEMENT. Measured 21-09-26: it is in
 *   the contract's `ids`; it is queried by b15probe.mjs:12; and
 *   `grep -c home-screen aws-quiz-app/index.html` = 0. DO NOT CREATE AN ELEMENT TO SATISFY A
 *   TYPO — if #home-screen ever turns out to be load-bearing that is a ruling, not an edit.
