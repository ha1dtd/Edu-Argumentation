/**
 * gate-r-b15.mjs — B15 PARITY: the deep-link defect must be REPRODUCED on the React port,
 * not fixed and not replaced by a different one.
 *
 * edu-replatform Phase 03, Exit Gate row "B15 is reproduced, not fixed". Tier 1, browser.
 *
 * ⛔ NOT REGISTERED IN run-gates-react.sh — the same standing as gate-c-theme.mjs. The Exit
 *    Gate lists B15 as its own command (`node gates/b15probe.mjs`), and b15probe.mjs is an
 *    AGENT-PROBE that cannot fail by construction ("T13 — Agent-Probe, NOT an assertion").
 *    This file is that probe's missing ASSERTION. It is kept out of the frozen R- vector so
 *    a product-side red does not turn the automated Tier-1 fence into a suite people learn
 *    to ignore — but it is executable, so the finding is a command and not a paragraph.
 *
 * ⛔ "SAME RESULT" IS DEFINED, NOT IMPLIED (C-6): compare ONLY `visibleScreens` and `hash`,
 *    before and after the LEARN click. ⛔ NEVER the pixel geometry — b15probe emits
 *    tutorial-content=1018x3144, which legitimately differs on a React port.
 *
 * ⛔ A "FIXED" B15 IS A FAILED GATE. The legacy behaviour is: arriving on a deep link and
 *    clicking LEARN DISCARDS it, jumps to nextLesson() and STAMPS THE HASH
 *    (app.js:1238-1241 -> selectTheory() writes the hash). Fixing that is a Phase 04+
 *    decision WITH ITS OWN GATE CHANGE, not a side effect of a port. R-B15b below asserts
 *    the discard EXPLICITLY (conjunct 1) so a "fix" cannot read green.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * ⛔⛔ REWRITTEN 2026-09-22 (item C) — R-B15b WAS A STALE-LITERAL GATE DEFECT.
 * ============================================================================
 * WHAT IT USED TO DO, and why that was wrong:
 *   It pinned `after.hash === '#chapter=1&block=1'`, a literal measured on :8791 against an
 *   EMPTY progress store. But the destination is `nextLesson()`, which is A FUNCTION OF THE
 *   PROGRESS STORE. The user's live store holds 18 completions, so `nextLesson()` correctly
 *   returns ch02-b07 and the gate read RED at 2/3 — against a product that was behaving
 *   EXACTLY as B15 specifies. Three independent runs confirmed it: 3/3 on :8791, 3/3 on a
 *   clean-store instance of the byte-identical deployed bundle, 2/3 on the live store.
 *
 *   ⛔ THE FIX IS TO THE **GATE**, NOT THE PRODUCT. B15 is still reproduced, defect intact.
 *
 *   ⛔ It is the SIXTH instance of the stale-literal class in this program — after
 *      `total === 21`, `-eq 49`, the B1 `=== 41` temptation, F-1's mtime and A-G17's
 *      fixture — the class `deploy-study.sh` now bans by name. The tell is always the same:
 *      an assertion pins a number that MOVES ON ITS OWN, so the gate measures the
 *      environment instead of the behaviour.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOW — assert the BEHAVIOUR, derive the number:
 *   R-B15b is a CONJUNCTION of two halves, and both are load-bearing:
 *     (1) DISCARD  — `after.hash !== deepLinkHash`. This IS the defect. If someone "fixes"
 *                    B15 so the deep link is honoured, this half goes RED, which is the
 *                    required outcome.
 *     (2) DESTINATION — `after.hash === nextLessonHash`, where nextLessonHash is COMPUTED
 *                    HERE from two live reads: `/book/<id>/module.json` (chapter and block
 *                    counts) and `/api/progress?module=<id>` (the completions). Nothing is
 *                    pinned; the expectation moves with the store exactly as the product
 *                    does.
 *   Splitting them matters: (2) alone would pass a product that never moved the hash if the
 *   deep link happened to BE the next lesson, and (1) alone would pass a jump to anywhere.
 *
 * ⛔ ANTI-VACUITY FENCE. If the derived next-lesson hash EQUALS the deep-link hash, the two
 *    conjuncts contradict each other and the run can distinguish nothing. That is not a
 *    failure of the product, so the gate THROWS rather than reporting either colour —
 *    silence would be a gate reporting a verdict it did not earn.
 *
 * BASELINE — `visibleScreens` only. It is store-INDEPENDENT (which screens are on, not
 * which lesson), so it stays a literal. Measured on :8791 21-09-26, re-measured 22-09-26.
 *
 * Run it against either stack:
 *   GATE_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8791            node gate-r-b15.mjs   # legacy — expect GREEN
 *   GATE_BASE=http://192.168.100.66:8792       node gate-r-b15.mjs   # React  — the real check
